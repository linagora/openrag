# Refactoring Decision Log

Records **why** decisions were made that deviate from or extend the refactoring
docs. When a decision changes the plan, update the strategy/workflow docs to
reflect the new reality — then log the reasoning here so future readers know
why the docs changed.

Source abbreviations:
- STRATEGY = `docs/refactoring/REFACTORING_STRATEGY_v1.md`
- WORKFLOW = `docs/refactoring/REFACTORING_DEV_WORKFLOW.md`

## Phase 0 — Scaffold + import guard + CI wiring (2026-04-21)

**1. The guard ignores files outside the four new layer roots.**
Files under `openrag/components/`, `openrag/routers/`, `openrag/models/`,
`openrag/config/`, `openrag/utils/` are skipped.
- Why: Phase 0's verification requires existing tests to keep passing. If the
  guard ran against legacy code, every old import that doesn't fit the new
  rules would trip the check and block the phase. Legacy code gets migrated in
  Phases 5–12 and the guard picks those files up as they move into the new
  layer roots.
- Alternative considered: whitelist-only enforcement on new code (same idea,
  different framing). What we chose is "enforce wherever the file lives in one
  of the four roots", which is simpler.

**2. Split CI into `layer_guard.yml` + extending existing `lint.yml` and
`unit_tests.yml`, instead of one new `refactor-ci.yml`.**
WORKFLOW's CI example is a single file with three jobs (`unit-tests`,
`layer-guard`, `docker-build`). We took a different shape.
- Why: We already have a well-set-up `unit_tests.yml` and `lint.yml`. Creating
  a parallel `refactor-ci.yml` with its own unit-tests job would duplicate the
  uv setup and caching. Extending the existing files adds a few lines of
  config and reuses everything.
- Alternative considered: follow the WORKFLOW example literally. Rejected for
  the duplication reason above. Trade-off is that refactor-specific CI isn't
  all in one file.

**3. `docker-build` CI check NOT wired in Phase 0.**
WORKFLOW lists it as a required check.
- Why: Existing `build.yml` and `build_dev.yml` workflows push images to ghcr,
  which isn't what we want on every refactor push. A lightweight "docker build
  only, don't push" check needs a new job. Deferred to keep Phase 0 scope
  tight. Docker build was verified locally on the phase-0 tree.
- Alternative considered: add the job in this phase. Rejected for scope.
  Follow-up: add a `docker-build` job in a separate PR, modelled on the
  WORKFLOW CI example.

**4. Decision log policy: log reasoning, update docs.**
When a decision deviates from the strategy/workflow docs, update the docs to
match reality, then record the reasoning here.
- Why: The docs should always reflect the current plan. The log captures
  why the plan changed, not what the plan is.
